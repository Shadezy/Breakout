# Breakout
Breakout game app that was the final project for my Android Development class. It was enough work, and I was proud of it enough for it to get its own repository.

Installation: If you have an android device, simply enable developer options and allow your phone to install apps from unknown sources, and then download the apk from whichever project and put it on your phone and run it. If you wish to use an emulator, then do the same steps, but on that instead.

Game functions exactly like breakout, but always bounces at a 90-degree angle. There is a settings menu that gives extra customization to the game, such as adding more lives, or more bricks. The game must be restarted before the changes take effect.
